commit 138ba96c88cd083a96725041b2e580002e1f7a0a: Previuos commit, was initilizing all data in the StockCard compoent. StockCard should have a single use, 
                                                oraganizing data for a single stock. This allows the use of the added vue-model of how many stocks you would buy for that single stock
                                                If it was using the old commit, all the stocks would have the same amount of buyStocks, this way it is invadidually stored in the compoent.
